  Once setup is complete, the user may simply run the program by typing 'node index.js' into the main folder's terminal. The user will be asked multiple questions regarding the project they are creating a README.md for. Once the program is out of questions, the README.md will be automatically generated, and can be adjusted to the user's preference.

  ## <a name="installation"></a>Installation
  To install, the user will download the repository to their system. As the inquirer package is utilized, the user must start by installing this package (npm install inquirer). Once inquirer is finished installing into the program's folder, the user may run the program by typing 'node index.js'.
  ## <a name="usage"></a>Usage
  The intended usage for this program is to shorten the time it takes to create viable README.md for developers that have many projects to create in their future.
